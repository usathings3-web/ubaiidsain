  <h2>Car Insurance in the UK – Complete Guide</h2>
  <p>
    Car insurance in the United Kingdom is a legal requirement for all drivers.
    Choosing the right policy not only protects you financially but can also
    save you hundreds of pounds every year.
  </p>

  <h2>Types of Car Insurance in the UK</h2>

  <h3>1. Third-Party Only</h3>
  <p>
    This is the minimum legal requirement. It covers damage or injury to other
    people but does not cover your own vehicle.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Third-Party, Fire and Theft</h3>
  <p>
    This policy covers third-party liabilities and also protects your car
    against fire damage and theft.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Comprehensive Car Insurance</h3>
  <p>
    Comprehensive insurance provides the highest level of cover, including
    damage to your own vehicle, even if you are at fault.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Tip:</strong> Comprehensive cover is often cheaper than third-party
    policies due to lower risk profiles.
